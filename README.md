**Note:** This application was meant to be used with the relevant hardware we created during our hackathon. Because you will not have access to our hardware, you will only be able to view an example of our applications dashboard. While viewing this live project, please keep in mind that our applications dashboard contains static "dummy" data, due to the lack of hardware needed for a proper demonstration.
