# Context
**Beeutiful Tracking Systems** is a hackathon project I developed during ShellHacks 2017.

&nbsp;

ShellHacks is a 36-hour hackathon at Florida International University (FIU), which took place the weekend of Friday, September 29 to Sunday, October 1st.

Their mission is to provide students with the opportunity to learn about new technologies, create innovative projects, and share their work with the community!

**Note:** This application was meant to be used with the relevant hardware we created during our hackathon. Because you will not have access to our hardware, you will only be able to view an example of our applications dashboard. While viewing this live project, please keep in mind that our applications dashboard contains static "dummy" data, due to the lack of hardware needed for a proper demonstration.

## FAQ

**How can your device know the difference between a bee exiting a hive compared to a bee entering a hive?**

We have two infrared sensors, let us call them ‚Äúsensor 1‚Äù and ‚Äúsensor 2‚Äù. Our device becomes the only entrance/exit solution the bees have to access their hive. Inside our unit, sensor 1 is placed behind of sensor 2.

If sensor 1 registers movement and then sensor 2 registers movement ‚Äì that equals one bee ‚ÄúExit‚Äù from the hive.

If sensor 2 registers movement and then sensor 1 registers movement ‚Äì that equals one bee ‚ÄúEntrance‚Äù to the hive.
